# Emulation vs Simulation

## Emulation

### Purpose

Emulation involves replicating the behavior of one system on a different system, usually with the intent of replacing the original system with a new one that performs the same functions. It is commonly used when migrating legacy systems to newer hardware or software platforms.

### Characteristics

Emulation strives to achieve functional equivalence between the original and emulated systems. It allows applications to run unmodified on the new system, mimicking the original environment's behavior.

### Example

Emulating an older video game console on modern hardware, allowing old games to be played on new systems while maintaining the original game's behavior.

## Simulation

### Purpose

Simulation involves creating a virtual environment or model to mimic real-world processes, systems, or situations. It is often used for training, analysis, or experimentation without the need for real resources or risk. Simulations help understand complex systems and predict outcomes.

### Characteristics

Simulations aim to replicate the behavior of a system under various conditions to observe its responses and outcomes. They can involve mathematical models, software-based models, or physical models.

### Example

Flight simulators used by pilots to practice flying aircraft in a safe and controlled environment, allowing them to experience various scenarios and emergencies.

## Key Differences

### Purpose and Scope

- Emulation replicates the behavior of one specific system on another system, often for replacement or compatibility.
- Simulation creates virtual models of systems or scenarios to understand behaviors, predict outcomes, or train without real-world risks.

### Functionality

0 Emulation aims for functional equivalence to ensure applications run the same way as on the original system.
0 Simulation focuses on capturing the behavior of a system, often with a degree of approximation.

### Usage

- Emulation is commonly used for legacy system migration, software compatibility, and hardware replacement.
- Simulation is used for training, analysis, experimentation, and understanding complex systems.

### Outcome

- Emulation seeks to achieve identical behavior between the original and emulated systems.
- Simulation aims to provide insights into system behavior, predictions, or learning outcomes.
